      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Neokingdoms</em> are constitutional DAOcracies. They serve a
        collective of humans with a common goal. Fairness, decision making, and
        rewarding of those who create value are technology based and happen in
        the virtual realm. The purpose is to create a better existence for
        everyone on earth.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Neokingdoms</em> are EVM based, legally compliant DAOs which rely on
        a legal model crafted by
        <a href="https://www.oblicity.com">Oblicity</a>, an Estonian law firm
        using the favorable Estonian legal system.
      </p>
      <p>
        ODOO, an open source ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning System) is used
        as the digital backbone to be able to run and administer a full-fledged
        organization or brick-and-mortar businesses for real-world uses cases.
      </p>
      <p>Users vote and interact with the DAO using a progressive web app.</p>
      <p>
        <em>
          The core principle is that contributors of the DAO can invest their
          personal time or money to receive shares of the organization. Those
          shares represent ownership, voting and dividend rights.
        </em>

      <h2>How</h2>
      <p>
        We are building <em>neokingdom DAO</em> for real world use cases. To
        find the right balance between idealism and pragmatism, we decided to
        test the system ourselves while we are developing it—some people call
        this approach <em>dogfooding</em>, some others call it
        <em>having skin in the game</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why on July 27th, 2022 we transformed our company,
        <a href="https://www.teledisko.com/">teledisko&nbsp;GmbH</a> into the
        first <em>neokingdom</em>. This means that the decisional process of the
        company happens
        <a href="https://dao.teledisko.com/#/resolutions">on–chain</a>,
        contributors are rewarded Teledisko Tokens, and many other things that
        you can find in our
        <a href="https://github.com/TelediskoDAO/legal/">legal documentation</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are using the system we built to test our assumptions, and we are
        actively evolving the legal and technical framework to adapt it to the
        challenges we are facing. Once we are ready we will make our framework,
        <em>neokingdom</em>, available to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recently took part in the
        <a href="https://evmos2022.devpost.com/">EVMOS Momentum Hackathon</a>,
        and
        <a href="https://devpost.com/software/teledisko-dao"
          ><em>neokingdom DAO</em> has been awarded the second prize</a
        >
        in the web3 track.
